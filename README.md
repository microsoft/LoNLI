# LoNLI v1.0

We release CheckList-based behavioral testsuite *LoNLI* dataset associated with [LoNLI: An Extensible Framework for Testing Diverse Logical Reasoning Capabilities for NLI
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.02333). *Our work is under review at LREV. We will soon update the version once accepted.*

We create a semi-synthetic large test-bench (363 templates, 363k examples) and an associated framework that offers following utilities: 
1) individually test and analyze reasoning capabilities along 17 reasoning dimensions (including pragmatic reasoning), 
2) design experiments to study cross-capability information content (leave one out or bring one in); and 
3) the synthetic nature enable us to control for artifacts and biases.

## Files

1. `data/data_v2.zip` - Unzip it to find 363 files. Each files is named with the corresponding capability (borrowed from [TaxiNLI](https://github.com/microsoft/TaxiNLI)).
   - For example `boolean_1.tsv` contains the examples form `boolean_1` template (found in `data/checklist_master.tsv`). 
   - Each file contains three columns "premise", "hypothesis" and "label"
2. `data/checklist_master.tsv` - The list of all 363 templates and corresponding generated file-names.
3. `templates.ipynb` - The python notebook is a single-stop shop for creating data for all templates. It uses the `lexicon.py`
   - The notebook needs the following packages to run: `copy`, `num2words`, `checklist`
   - To run the notebook, please install using `pip install -r requirements.txt` 
   - Please also checkout the [CheckList](https://github.com/marcotcr/checklist) repository.
